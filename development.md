# Development

This library is still in development. It can already be used with websockets and it has some nice features like gap detection. <br />
But things may change a little bit in the future, so give a look to the TODO list below. <br />
If you want to help in the development of this library please open a PR on github, while if you find any problem open an issue. <br /> <br />
TODO List:

- Irregular seat sections
- Replace licenced icons
- Decrease access to the DOM (e.g. `getSeatName()`)
- Replace current seat indexing with a simple one: an object `{ r: 10, c: 10 }`
- Add 'static' mode where seat types are defined on creation
- Show a dropdown menu, on click, to select seat type
- Add themes
- Add multi-language support
- Backend and frontend example with websockets
- Minified source
- Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Use Travis CI and deploy to npm an alpha
- Release v1.0.0
