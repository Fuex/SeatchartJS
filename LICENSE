Changes: "soundoff.svg" is an edited version of the original "soundon.svg" icon, 
the waves near the speaker are deleted and an "x" was added to make a "no sound" icon.
"bin.svg" icon is an edited version of the original, infact the background 
is converted from black to white to increase the contrast and give a nicer effect. 
(Changes made in Inkscape)
